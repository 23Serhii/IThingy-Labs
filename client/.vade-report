# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js 15.5.9 application using the App Router.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package using npm
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the locked dependency tree

### 2. Root Layout Configuration
**Modified:** `src/app/layout.tsx`

- Added import statement: `import {SpeedInsights} from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `<ThemeProvider>` and `{children}`
- Placement ensures the Speed Insights tracking is initialized on all pages while preserving existing layout structure

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the recommended approach for Next.js 13.5+ with App Router:
- Using `@vercel/speed-insights/next` import (App Router specific)
- Component added to root layout for site-wide tracking
- Positioned after children content to avoid blocking initial render
- No configuration needed as the component uses default settings

## Verification

✅ **Build Test:** Successfully built the production bundle with `npm run build`
- No build errors
- All routes compiled successfully
- Build completed in ~5.7s with Turbopack

✅ **Linter:** Passed with `npm run lint`
- No new errors or warnings introduced
- Only pre-existing warning in `next.config.ts` (unrelated to changes)

✅ **Integration:** SpeedInsights component properly integrated without breaking existing functionality
- Preserves ThemeProvider wrapping
- Maintains existing layout structure
- Compatible with existing Script components

## Files Changed
1. `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
2. `package-lock.json` - Updated dependency lock file
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights component to root layout

## Notes
- The Speed Insights will automatically track Core Web Vitals and performance metrics
- Data will be visible in the Vercel dashboard once deployed
- No additional configuration is required for basic functionality
- The component is lightweight and doesn't impact page load performance
